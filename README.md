This is a Job Finder app built using React-Native and Expo. Users can search for jobs in their area, find all the information needed, and apply to them after following the redirect link.


To Run Application:
1.) Download code from repo.
2.) Add Expo-API Key where required to populate app.
3.) Run 'npm start' in terminal.
4.) Use Camera phone to scan QR code to open application.
5.) Find a job! :)

===============================================

Since Expos app hosting can be inconsistent I would recommend following the steps above to run the application. But here is link you can open on your device to preview as well:
